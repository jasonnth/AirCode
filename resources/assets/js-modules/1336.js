NPP belongs to the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily of enzymes.[2] Humans express seven known NPP isoforms,[3] some of which prefer nucleotide substrates, some of which prefer phospholipid substrates, and others of which prefer substrates that have not yet been determined.[4] In eukaryotes, most NPPs are located in the cell membrane and hydrolyze extracellular phosphate diesters to affect a wide variety of biological processes.[5][6] Bacterial NPP is thought to localize to the periplasm.[1]","State Route 31 (SR 31) is a Washington state highway located entirely in Pend Oreille County.

The rather solid shell has an elongate-conical shape. It is imperforate, but with a groove and pit or even a slight perforation at the place of the umbilicus. It is whitish, longitudinally clouded with brown or pink, often showing white opaque scattered dots. The surface is polished. The sculpture consists of numerous broad flat smooth spirals, separated by impressed lines. There are seven of these flat spiral ribs on the upper surface of the body whorl, the peripheral one larger. The base of the shell has numerous concentric striae, and about 4 spaced, more impressed grooves. The spire is high with its lateral outlines nearly straight . There are about 8 whorls, each one a trifle convex, the last angular at the periphery. The base of the shell is a little convex. The aperture is quadrate. The columella is vertical and obliquely truncate at its base.[4]",'3 Mustaphas 3 is a British World music band formed in 1982.
